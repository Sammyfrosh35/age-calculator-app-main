## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript

### What I learned

The Age calculator app was a good challenge for testing form validation, javascript and working with dates of which gave me a tough time to get the logics and most especially the animation.


The second problem that I encountered was adding animations to the page after data has been calculated


### Continued development

I want to continue sharpening my JS skills and including accessibility best practices. I'm also really interested in growing my animation skills.
